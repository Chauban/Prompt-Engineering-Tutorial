# Prompt-Engineering-Tutorial

We have witnessed the tremendous impact of AI in enhancing efficiency and unleashing creativity. The introduction of GPTs could affect at least 10% of work tasks for around 80% of the U.S. workforce, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. 

As AI becomes increasingly important in our daily lives, it is crucial for everyone to master prompt engineering, which will become as basic a skill as cooking or driving.

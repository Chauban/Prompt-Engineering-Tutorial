## Introduction

### What is prompt engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art of working with large language models (LLMs). It is how you teach LLMs to produce the desired outputs. 

### What does prompt engineering do?

Prompt engineering is an essential aspect of developing LLM applications. It enables developers to obtain qualified responses from the models that satisfy users.
example:

### Why should we learn prompt engineering?

We have witnessed the tremendous impact of AI in enhancing efficiency and unleashing creativity. The introduction of GPTs could affect at least 10% of work tasks for around 80% of the U.S. workforce, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted [1]. 

As AI becomes increasingly important in our daily lives, it is crucial for everyone to master prompt engineering, which will become as basic a skill as cooking or driving.

### How to make good prompts?

Getting the desired output from LLMs is not an easy task. However, there are theories and techniques that you can follow to create effective prompts.

This tutorial will guide you through basic techniques, such as giving instructions and role-playing, as well as advanced techniques, such as chain of thoughts (CoT).

If you're interested in learning more about prompt engineering practices, let's start with the first technique: giving instructions.

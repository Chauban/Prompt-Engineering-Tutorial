## Chain of Thought

Chain of Thought (CoT) refers to a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final answer for a problem. Including chain-of-thought reasoning in the exemplars for few-shot prompting can significantly improve the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning.

### Tasks and Performance

Experiments has shown that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

#### Arithmetic Task

#### Commonsense Task

#### Symbolic Task

### Limitations

Chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent ability of model scale. That is, chain-of-though prompting does not positively impact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of ~100B parameters.

## Zero Shot Chain of Thought

Zero Shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot CoT) prompting[2] is a follow-up to CoT prompting. The authors found that LLMs become decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding "Letâ€™s think step by step" before each answer.

### Examples

### Results
Experimental results demonstrate that Zero-shot-CoT outperforms LLMs' zero-shot performances on diverse benchmark reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, symbolic reasoning, and other logical reasoning tasks.

### Limitation
LLMs have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a method that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various tasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings.
